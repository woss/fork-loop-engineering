# loop-context

**Stateful memory manager for agent loops.** Keeps the context window clean and stops runaway loops before they burn tokens.

Long-running agent loops fail in two classic ways the [loop-engineering docs](../../docs/) warn about:

- **Context overflow & rot** — conversation history and error logs grow until the model loses the original goal or drowns in stale stack traces.
- **Stagnant / no-progress loops** — the agent retries the same failing action forever, quietly blowing the token budget.

`loop-context` sits between the agent and its durable memory (`STATE.md`, run logs) and, before each iteration, does three things:

1. **Summarize** what has been tried and what failed.
2. **Prune** verbose stack traces, collapse repeated errors, and drop stale attempts outside a recent window.
3. **Inject** only the essentials into the next prompt.

A **circuit breaker** watches iteration count, token spend, stagnation (same error N× in a row), and no-progress (too many consecutive failures) — and escalates to a human instead of looping in vain.

Everything is **deterministic and dependency-free**: no LLM call is needed to summarize or prune, so it is cheap enough to run on every iteration.

## Install / run

```bash
npx @cobusgreyling/loop-context --help
# or from this repo:
cd tools/loop-context && npm install && npm test
```

## The ledger

The tool reads a **run ledger** — a JSON record of the loop's goal and its attempts:

```json
{
  "goal": "Get the failing migration test to pass",
  "attempts": [
    { "iteration": 1, "action": "run migration", "outcome": "failure",
      "error": "Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432", "tokensUsed": 1500 },
    { "iteration": 2, "action": "run migration again", "outcome": "failure",
      "error": "Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432", "tokensUsed": 1400 }
  ]
}
```

`outcome` is `success | failure | noop`. `error` and `tokensUsed` are optional.

## Usage

```bash
# Circuit breaker — exit 0 = continue, 2 = escalate (wire into a loop's control flow)
loop-context --check --ledger run.json

# Compact context block for the next prompt
loop-context --inject --ledger run.json

# Factual rollup of the run
loop-context --summary --ledger run.json --json

# Pruned ledger (recent window, trimmed traces, collapsed repeats)
loop-context --prune --ledger run.json

# Pipe on stdin
cat run.json | loop-context --check
```

### Options

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| `--max-iterations <n>` | 10 | Hard iteration cap |
| `--stagnation <n>` | 3 | Escalate when the same error repeats N× in a row |
| `--no-progress <n>` | 5 | Escalate after N consecutive failures |
| `--token-budget <n>` | none | Escalate when cumulative tokens reach the cap |
| `--window <n>` | 5 | Attempts kept when pruning |
| `--max-trace-lines <n>` | 8 | Stack-trace lines kept when pruning |

Exit codes: `0` continue · `2` escalate · `1` error.

## Resolving the token budget from a pattern

Typing `--token-budget <n>` by hand means guessing. [`loop-cost`](../loop-cost) already
computes a realistic per-run estimate for every pattern and readiness level, so resolve
the cap from there instead:

```bash
loop-context --check --ledger run.json --budget-from-pattern ci-sweeper --budget-level L2
```

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| `--budget-from-pattern <id>` | none | Pattern id to look up in `loop-cost`'s registry |
| `--budget-level <L1\|L2\|L3>` | `L1` | Readiness level passed to `loop-cost` |
| `--budget-scenario <realistic\|action\|report>` | `realistic` | Which `loop-cost` scenario to use as the cap |
| `--budget-cadence <spec>` | pattern default | Cadence override passed through to `loop-cost` |
| `--budget-conservative` | off | Use the slower cadence in a range (`loop-cost`'s own flag) |

An explicit `--token-budget <n>` always wins over `--budget-from-pattern` — the derived
value only fills in when no number was typed. `loop-context` shells out to `loop-cost`'s
built CLI (monorepo sibling first, then an installed `@cobusgreyling/loop-cost`
dependency) — the same resolution `loop-init` already uses for `loop-audit` — so the two
packages stay independent at the source level; an unknown pattern id surfaces
`loop-cost`'s own error instead of failing silently.

## Populating the ledger

Your loop control script appends one object per iteration to `run.json` (or pipes the same shape on stdin):

```bash
# after each agent iteration — append attempt, then gate the next one
node -e "
const fs = require('fs');
const ledger = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('run.json', 'utf8'));
ledger.attempts.push({
  iteration: ledger.attempts.length + 1,
  action: 'run migration tests',
  outcome: 'failure',
  error: process.argv[1],
  tokensUsed: Number(process.argv[2] || 0),
});
fs.writeFileSync('run.json', JSON.stringify(ledger, null, 2));
" \"\$ERROR_MSG\" \"\$TOKENS\"
loop-context --check --ledger run.json || { loop-context --inject --ledger run.json; exit 2; }
```

Initialize once at loop start: `{ \"goal\": \"Get CI green on main\", \"attempts\": [] }`.

## In a loop

```bash
# inside your loop's control script, before each iteration:
if ! loop-context --check --ledger run.json; then
  loop-context --inject --ledger run.json > escalation.md   # hand a clean summary to the human
  exit 0                                                     # stop instead of retrying
fi
```

## Library API

```ts
import {
  checkCircuitBreaker,
  pruneLedger,
  summarizeAttempts,
  buildContextInjection,
} from '@cobusgreyling/loop-context';

const decision = checkCircuitBreaker(ledger);
if (decision.escalate) escalateToHuman(decision.reason);
else runNextIteration(buildContextInjection(ledger));
```

## Where it fits

This is the **Memory / State** primitive of loop engineering made dynamic: `STATE.md` stores state statically; `loop-context` manages it across iterations. See [docs/primitives.md](../../docs/primitives.md) and the [operating & safety](../../docs/) guides.
