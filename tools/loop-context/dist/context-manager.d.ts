/**
 * Stateful Memory Manager — Context Manager, Pruner, and Circuit Breaker.
 *
 * Sits between an agent loop and its durable memory (STATE.md, run logs).
 * Before each new iteration it can: summarize what has been tried, prune stale
 * or verbose context (long stack traces, repeated errors), and inject only the
 * essentials into the next prompt — keeping the context window clean and focused.
 *
 * The circuit breaker detects the two classic loop failures the docs warn about:
 *   - stagnant runs (retrying the same error N times)
 *   - no-progress loops (repeated failures with no success)
 * and, together with iteration and token caps, escalates to a human instead of
 * burning tokens in a hopeless loop.
 *
 * All logic here is deterministic and dependency-free — no LLM call is required
 * to summarize or prune, so it is cheap to run on every iteration and easy to test.
