**Status:** Draft for human review ([#332](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/loop-engineering/issues/332)). Edit before publishing a discussion post or tagging packages.

**Last published:** [Discussion #294](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/loop-engineering/discussions/294) (2026-07-16) — `loop-context` 1.2.0, `loop-worktree` 1.1.0.

**Window:** 2026-07-16 → 2026-07-22

## Highlights

### Prompt caching cost model ([#346](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/loop-engineering/pull/346), [#347](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/loop-engineering/pull/347))

- **`loop-cost` 1.2.0** — `--with-caching` scenario + `stable_fraction` on patterns in `registry.yaml` (cache-read discount on stable report/action tokens).
- **`loop-context` 1.5.0** — `--budget-scenario caching` resolves a cap from the new scenario (shells out with `--with-caching`).

```bash
npx @cobusgreyling/loop-cost --pattern daily-triage --level L1 --with-caching
npx @cobusgreyling/loop-context --check --ledger run.json \
  --budget-from-pattern daily-triage --budget-level L1 --budget-scenario caching
```

## Housekeeping

- PR triage 2026-07-22: merged #351/#350; closed #344 superseded; held then superseded #348.
- Feature PRs must include `package.json` bumps + this checklist row in the same change (lesson from #346/#347 gap).
